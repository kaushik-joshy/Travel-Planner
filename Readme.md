## 📌 Overview
The **Travel Planner** is a Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) based project built in **C++**.  
It helps users explore tourist spots, read reviews, and filter spots based on city or ratings.  
Data is read dynamically from two CSV files:  
- `tourist_spots.csv` → Spot details (name, city, rating, type, coordinates)  
- `spot_reviews.csv` → Reviews for each spot  

This project demonstrates **Linked Lists**, **file handling**, and basic **search/filter algorithms**.
